        Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896.
        usually celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad; summer and winter 
        games normally held in staggered even years.
        There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities, and 23 Winter 
        Olympic Games held in 20 cities.
        Berlin (summer) in 1916; Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) and Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen 
        (winter) in 1940; and London (summer) and Cortina (winter) in 1944. The 1906 Intercalated
        Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International 
        Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games.[1][2] The 2020 Summer Olympics
        in Tokyo were postponed for the first time in the Olympics history to summer 2021 due to the 
        COVID-19 pandemic with the 2022 Winter Olympics being held roughly six months later in Beijing.
